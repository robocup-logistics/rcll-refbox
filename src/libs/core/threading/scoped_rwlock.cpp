/** @class ScopedRWLock <core/threading/scoped_rwlock.h>
 * Scoped read/write lock.
 * This class is a convenience class which can help you prevent quite
 * a few headaches. Consider the following code.
 * @code
 * void my_function()
 * {
 *   rwlock->lock_for_write();
 *   for (int i = 0; i < LIMIT; ++i) {
 *     if ( failure ) {
 *       rwlock->unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   switch ( someval ) {
 *     VALA:
 *       rwlock->unlock();
 *       return;
 *     VALB:
 *       do_something();
 *   }
 *
 *   try {
 *     do_function_that_throws_exceptions();
 *   } catch (Exception &e) {
 *     rwlock->unlock();
 *     throw;
 *   }
 *   rwlock->unlock();
 * }
 * @endcode
 * This is not a complete list of examples but as you see if you have many
 * exit points in a function it becomes more and more work to have correct
 * locking behavior.
 *
 * This is a lot simpler with the ScopedRWLock. The ScopedRWLock locks the
 * given ReadWriteLock on creation, and unlocks it in the destructor. If you now
 * have a read/write locker on the stack as integral type the destructor is
 * called automagically on function exit and thus the lock is appropriately
 * unlocked.
 * The code would look like this:
 * @code
 * void my_function()
 * {
 *   ScopedRWLock lock(rwlock);
 *   // do anything, no need to call rwlock->lock_*()/unlock() if only has to be
 *   // called on entering and exiting the function.
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
