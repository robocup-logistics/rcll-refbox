/** @class InterruptibleBarrier <core/threading/barrier.h>
 * A barrier is a synchronization tool which blocks until a given number of
 * threads have reached the barrier. This particular implementations allows for
 * giving a timeout after which the waiting is aborted.
 *
 * For general information when a barrier is useful see the Barrier class.
 *
 * Additionally to the general barrier features the InterruptibleBarrier::wait()
 * can be given a timeout after which the waiting is aborted.
 * Since the POSIX standard does not provide a timed wait for barriers this
 * implementation uses a Mutex and WaitCondition internally to achieve the
 * desired result.
