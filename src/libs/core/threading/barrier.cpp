/** @class Barrier core/threading/barrier.h
 * A barrier is a synchronization tool which blocks until a given number of
 * threads have reached the barrier.
 *
 * Consider you have three threads all doing work. In the end you have to merge
 * their results. For this you need a point where all threads are finished. Of
 * course you don't want another thread waiting and periodically checking if
 * the other threads are finished, that will loose time - processing time and
 * the time that passed between the threads being finished and the time when
 * the controller checked again.
 *
 * For this problem we have a barrier. You initialize the barrier with the
 * number of threads to wait for and then wait in all threads at a specific
 * point. After this one of the threads can merge the result (and the others
 * may wait for another "go-on barrier".
 *
 * The code in the thread would be
 * @code
 * virtual void run()
 * {
 *   forever {
 *     do_something();
 *     result_barrier->wait();
 *     if ( master_thread ) {
 *       merge_results();
 *     }
 *     goon_barrier->wait();
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The threads would all get a reference to the same barriers and one would
 * have master thread to be true.
 *
 * After the barrier has been passed (count threads waited) the barrier is
 * reset automatically and can be re-used with the same amount of barrier
 * waiters.
 *
 * The implementation of Barrier takes into account that PThread barriers are
 * optional in POSIX. If barriers are not available they are emulated using a
 * wait condition. Note however that on systems that do have both, barriers and
 * wait conditions it has been observed that in a typical barrier scenario the
 * POSIX barriers perform much better in many situations than a wait condition
 * (processes tend to be rescheduled immediately if a barrier is reached, while
 * with a wait condition they are rescheduled with lower priority and thus they
 * delay may increase on a loaded system). Because of this on systems without
 * real POSIX barriers the performance may be not as good as is expected.
