/** @class WaitCondition <core/threading/wait_condition.h>
 * Wait until a given condition holds.
 * Consider two values x and y and you want to wait until they are equal.
 * For instance there may be a thread counting up after he has finished one
 * particular job before he goes to handle the next one. After 10 threads you
 * want to send out the produced entities in one batch run. So the sending
 * thread has to wait for the producing thread until 10 packages have been
 * produced. Simplified this could be implemented as
 *
 * @code
 * virtual void run()
 * {
 *   forever {
 *     mutex->lock();
 *     while (count != 10) {
 *       wait_condition->wait();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The other thread will wake up this waiting thread after each produced
 * package (the thread does not have to know after how many packages they are
 * sent out). The code could look like this:
 *
 * @code
 * virtual void run()
 * {
 *   forever {
 *     produce_package();
 *     wait_condition->wake_one();
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The WaitCondition can operate in two principal modes, either with an internal
 * or with an external Mutex. If no mutex is passed to the constructor an
 * internal mutex is created and used. If a mutex is passed this instance is used,
 * but ownership is not claimed and you have to delete it manually. Additionally,
 * for external mutexes they are <i>never</i> locked by the wait condition. For
 * external mutexes you get all the freedom, but also have the duty to ensure
 * proper locking from the outside! This applies to wait and wake methods.
