 * unregister.
 *
 * @fn bool ThreadNotificationListener::thread_init_failed(Thread *thread) throw()
 * Thread initialization failed.
 * This method is called by ThreadList if one of the threads in the list failed
 * to initialize. This is not necessarily the thread that you registered the
 * notification for. However, the argument is always the thread that you
 * registered for, no matter which thread in the list failed.
 * @param thread thread that you registered for
 * @return true to stay registered for further thread notifications, false to
