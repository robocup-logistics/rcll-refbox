/** @class ThreadCollector core/threading/thread_collector.h
 * Thread collector.
 * This interface is meant to provide a central place where to put threads
 * to have them referenced somewhere. Threads my be added and removed at
 * will. The main purpose of the collector is to tear down all threads if
 * the collector is deleted thus providing a clean exit.
 *
 * Additional functionality and aspect-specific behavior may be added in
 * implementations.

 *
 * @fn void ThreadCollector::add(ThreadList &tl) = 0
 * Add multiple threads.
 * Adds all the threads in the list to the thread list. Implementations may
 * throw an exception if this fails for whatever reason, read implementation
 * documentation for details. The operation shall be atomic, either all
 * threads are added successfully or none is added at all. If adding fails
 * a CannotInitializeThreadException is thrown.
 *
 * The thread is started if and only if initialization of all threads suceeds.
 * A CannotInitializeThreadException is thrown if initialization failed for
 * any thread.
 * @param tl list of threads to add
 *
 * @fn void ThreadCollector::add(Thread *t) = 0
 * Add single thread.
 * Adds the single thread to the internal (implementation specific) thread
 * list. The thread is started if and only if initialization suceeds.
 * A CannotInitializeThreadException is thrown if initialization failed.
 * @param t thread to add
 *
 * @fn ThreadCollector::remove(ThreadList &tl) = 0
 * Remove multiple threads.
 * Remove all threads in the thread list from this collector. If there is
 * a thread in the supplied thread list that has never been collected no
 * error shall be thrown but this just be silently ignored.
 *
 * The threads are finalized, cancelled and joined. If the finalization fails
 * for whatever reason the threads are NOT cancelled or stopped.
 * In that case a CannotFinalizeThreadException is thrown.
 * @param tl list of threads to remove
 *
 * @fn ThreadCollector::remove(Thread *t) = 0
 * Remove single thread.
 * Remove the thread from the internal thread list. If the thread has never
 * been collected no error shall be thrown but just be silently ignored.
 * The thread is finalized, cancelled and joined. If the finalization fails
 * for whatever reason the thread is NOT cancelled or stopped. In that case
 * a CannotFinalizeThreadException is thrown.
 * @param t Thread to remove.
 *
 * @fn ThreadCollector::force_remove(ThreadList &tl) = 0
 * Force removal of multiple threads.
 * Remove all threads in the thread list from this collector. If there is
 * a thread in the supplied thread list that has never been collected no
 * error shall be thrown but this just be silently ignored.
 *
 * The threads are finalized, cancelled and joined. The result of the finalization
 * is ignored and the thread is cancelled and joined in any case.
 * @param tl list of threads to remove
 *
 * @fn ThreadCollector::force_remove(Thread *t) = 0
 * Force removal of a single thread.
 * Remove the thread from the internal thread list. If the thread has never
 * been collected no error shall be thrown but just be silently ignored.
 * The threads are finalized, cancelled and joined. The result of the finalization
 * is ignored and the thread is cancelled and joined in any case.
