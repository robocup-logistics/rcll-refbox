 * Reference counting base class.
 * Derive this class with your object if you need reference counting for the object
 * thus that it is not deleted while some code is still using an class instance.
 *
 * The RefCount class is NOT meant for direct usage. In most cases if you are aware
 * of the need of reference couting during the design of the software derive this
 * class. This is the recommended way. If you want to use reference counting with
 * a class that you cannot or do not want to modify you can use the RefCounter
 * template class to accomplish the desired task.
