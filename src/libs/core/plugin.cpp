/** @class Plugin <core/plugin.h>
 * Plugin interface class.
 * Derive this class to create a new Fawkes plugin. There is not much that
 * you have to do to get a basic plugin working. The base plugin will already
 * handle all the important details.
 *
 * To implement a plugin create a new class that inherits from Plugin. Call
 * the Plugin constructor with the proper parameters in your derivate's
 * constructor. Then in your constructor fill the thread_list member with
 * the threads that your plugin needs. Instantiate all threads that your
 * plugin may ever need during its lifetime, creating (blocked timing)
 * threads during the life time of a plugin is not allowed. After the
 * constructor the thread list has to be considered to be sealed.
 * At the end of the file add a line like
 * @code
 * EXPORT_PLUGIN(PluginClass)
 * @endcode
 * where PluginClass is the class name of your plugin. This will create the
 * proper glue code to make this class loadable as plugin by Fawkes.

/* IMPLEMENTOR'S NOTE:
 * I'm aware that we do not link libfawkescore against libfawkesconfig, so why
 * do we put the reference to fawkes::Configuration here? Two things to consider:
 * 1. We only pass through the pointer, nothing more. We do not need to know about
 * the declaration or definition!
 * 2. We want to keep plugin.(h|cpp) in libfawkescore, rather than in
 * libfawkesplugin to keep the minimum requirements for plugins low.
