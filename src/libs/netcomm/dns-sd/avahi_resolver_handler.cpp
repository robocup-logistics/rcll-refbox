/** @class AvahiResolverHandler <netcomm/dns-sd/avahi_resolver_handler.h>
 * Avahi resolver handler interface.
 * This interface has to be implemented to make use of the threaded
 * Avahi lookup of names and addresses. After you have ordered a
 * lookup this handler is called with the result.

 * @ingroup NetComm
 * @author Tim Niemueller
 *
 * @fn void AvahiResolverHandler::resolved_name(char *name, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen) = 0
 * Name has been successfully resolved.
 * The ordered name lookup was successful for the given name resulting in
 * the given addr of addrlen bytes length.
 * Note that all of the parameters are given to the handler's ownership, that means
 * especially that the handler is responsible for freeing the associated memory
 * after it is done with the result using free() on name and addr.
 * @param name name that was resolved
 * @param addr resulting addr record, currently always of type struct sockaddr_in (only IPv4)
 * @param addrlen length of addr in bytes
 *

 * @fn void AvahiResolverHandler::name_resolution_failed(char *name) = 0
